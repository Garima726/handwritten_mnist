# handwritten_mnist

Test.rar, train.rar files were too big to upload directly. So, I am uploading the rar files. After extracting them, csv files can be used.

Training and testing data have all the pixel values. There are in total 784 pixels. They are already flattened in the files. I have reshape them to use convolutional method and achieved more accuracy. It was around 98% in 5 epochs. If eochs are increased, then 99.9% accuracy can be achieved.
